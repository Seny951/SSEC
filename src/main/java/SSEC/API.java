/* Authentication:
* For Authentication I would opt for a TLS approach.
*   Client Certificates could be generated using user credentials or a license key linked with a user account and
* valid serial / device ids in order to ensure the certificate is unique to a user account or specific device
* and cannot be transferred to be used elsewhere.
*
*   A client would initially request a key via an unsecure connection (i.e. an http interface),
* providing information about the user account and/or device
* which would be used by the server to generate a certificate unique to that user or device.
*
*   Once a certificate is obtained further api requests will be made on a secure connection (i.e. HTTPS) that
* validates certificates on each request via a TLS handshake and certification transfer.
*
*   An added benefit of TLS is that as well as the caller being validated the data transfer is also encrypted
